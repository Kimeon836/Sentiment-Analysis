loved it
fine product
bad and broken
this is a disappointing adaptation of the james lee burke novel in the electric of the dead it is rather poorly acted mainly due to the <UNK> of the principal players tommy lee jones a normally fine actor just doesn't capture <UNK> dave as main nemesis john goodman does a sloppy job as the heavy the guy who plays actor buddy doesn't look like a former a <UNK> leading man the rest of the movie is mainly cast with no name locals who just don't do justice to a big time novel br br the movie and jones' performance is way too <UNK> for one thing in <UNK> series of novels gives one the feeling that he fits well into his environment most of the time being laid back and slow moving this is just like the deep south and southern <UNK> then at times is nearly manic in his jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie he doesn't <UNK> ned beatty is wasted mary <UNK> is out of place about the only good thing about this is the setting on the whole the movie gives one the impression of a tv movie
After all these years of solving crimes you would've expected criminals to know that they can't afford making mistakes with him especially not with regards to talking much this time br br columbo goes to college and actually explains his entire technique but for some reason the murderer still doesn't pay enough attention however this still creates wonderful scenes and delightful dialogues
This is such a beautiful movie not only does it portray war it also has friendship love the life of is filled with sadness every aspect of his life fell apart i can only imagine how he would feel when his friend make the ultimate sacrifice br br i see a slight similarity to <UNK> <UNK> which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman however this film is much better made because this does not portray the woman to be <UNK> easy going the friendship between the two men is also much more convincing well built up i definitely recommend this movie to all people
