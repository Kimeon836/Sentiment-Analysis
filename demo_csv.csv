not that bad
loved it
not that good
 interesting twist on the vampire yarn fast loud and moody despite my initial fears kris k carries his part reasonably well and snipes aka blade provides a <UNK> physical presence lots of blood steel silver burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable <UNK> minute distraction if you like the black look of the matrix then blade will appeal to you blade even has a the sequence
this movie is really stupid and very boring most of the time there are almost no <UNK> in it at all there is nothing good about this movie on any level just more bad actors <UNK> attempting to make a movie so they can get enough money to eat avoid at all costs
